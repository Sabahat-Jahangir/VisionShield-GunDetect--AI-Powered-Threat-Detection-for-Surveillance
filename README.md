# VisionShield-GunDetect 🔫🛡️  
### Real-Time Firearm Detection System using YOLOv10 & Custom Training  

This project is a **cybersecurity + computer vision** solution designed to automatically detect **guns/weapons** in images and video streams.  
It can be integrated into **CCTV surveillance systems**, **threat monitoring**, and **law-enforcement intelligence workflows**.

Built and trained using **YOLOv10**, custom dataset labeling, and tested on both images and MP4 video footage.

## 🚨 Project Overview

Modern security systems need automated tools to detect threats in real-time.  
This project solves that by using a trained YOLO model to:

✔ Detect guns in **images**  
✔ Detect guns in **video (frame-by-frame analysis)**  
✔ Annotate threats with bounding boxes  
✔ Save an output video showing detection results  
✔ Train a custom YOLO model using Kaggle dataset  

This is ideal for:

- Cybersecurity threat detection  
- Smart surveillance systems  
- AI for law enforcement  
- Security automation research  
- Computer Vision + AI academic projects
